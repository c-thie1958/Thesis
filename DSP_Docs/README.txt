CAPT Thiessen,

 

I included the following in the zip file that I sent via SAFE:

 

1- The GNU Radio flowgraph that we used to record the data along with the blocks that we used to replay the recorded data, filter, resample and re-save the data.

2- The filtered, resampled data for frsky, phanom 4, MRO900 GCS, and MRO900 TEL signals.

3- MATLAB script that imports the recorded data in order to visualize them in time and frequency.

 

I chose to pick one of the signal hops from each recording, but different signal hops can be picked by modifying the MATLAB script. Some of the signals are a bit off from baseband, so frequency shifting is needed before attempting to demodulate.

 

Let me know if you have questions!
